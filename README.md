# Linked List and Stack

This assignment composed of implementing and testing the Linked List implemented in link_list.py and stack.py

## Getting Started

Run setup.py if needed. Then 'Tox'

### Test Data

To test the data, we created custom matrices and strings to test proper assignments, predicted results, and pointer head tracking. These are implemented in their respected files namely, test_stack.py and test_linked_list.py

Further testing of Lucas and Sum Series are similarly implemented.

## Deployment

Deployment and testing could easily be done via cutting and pasting specific functions this to the python/Ipthon interpreter, or running the tox script or the specific test files.
